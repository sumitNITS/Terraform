## AWS-Aurora
Amazon Aurora is a fully-managed relational database service provided by AWS which is compatible with both MySQL and PostgreSQL. It is designed to be highly available, scalable, and fault-tolerant. Few most important features of Aurora includes Automated and instant backups which means Aurora can automatically backs up the entire data to Amazon S3 and can allows point-in-time recovery. Aurora supports Automatic and synchronous replication which means Aurora replicates the data across multiple availability zones to provide high availability and durability. Also, Aurora supports Auto-scaling too which means Aurora automatically scales the storage capacity of a database based on the amount of data stored. Last but not the least Aurora supports Aurora Serverless which is a variant of Aurora that automatically starts, scales capacity up or down based on application needs and stops resources when they are no longer needed.

Use cases: We can use Aurora in data warehousing use cases where large amounts of data need to be analyzed and queried. Aurora can be used as a database for content management systems such as WordPress where it can provide a robust and scalable solution for managing large numbers of users, posts, and comments. Aurora can also be used to power the backend of web and mobile applications where it can provide fast and reliable performance for high traffic applications.
